# the_brave_six (an among us clone with a twist)
## Application Suitability
1. Why is this application relevant?
- Among us is one of the most popular games for some time now with its easy to understand dynamic mechanics that appear very appealing for many people and in this project I'll try to recreate this hopefully simple game 
2. Why does this game can use a microservice architecture?
- the microservice architecture offers a more loosely coupled design which can help develop and test every part of the project faster because of it's more independant structure.
- easier for scaling the game to manage the larger number of players in the game in the future using docker containers for example.
- In a microservice architecture, the failure of one service (like the login for example) doesn't necesarly crash the whole game.
